## Project Description

Firebase provides set of hosting services like NoSQL and real-time databases, social authentication, and notifications, etc . Team Edison presents <b>Joli App</b> . Joli is an app build on Flutter and we have used Firebase as the database too . So dear Employees , just create a new account in the app and put a full stop to your local job hunts and dear employers start seizing the best damn workers to meet your tasks .

*We intend to solve unemployment and ensure the supply of expertised workers.

*We plan on developing an app which can be used by people to get in touch with expert workers to provide them with chores and services .

*Thus we will be helping unemployed laborers to get work and support themselves in this pandemic hit economy.

*We will also be helping out people searching for skilled laborers to meet their needs for an affordable rate.


***In our app people could register themselves up as a laborer or an emoloyer where employees give up their necessary info and empployers can :
 
 --phone them
  
  --see their position in google maps with respect to the registered location of employees choice of work area.
  
  --pay them through razorpay
  
  and much more in future!!!!
